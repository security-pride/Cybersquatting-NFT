**Data Availability Statement**

Due to GitHub's 2GB storage limit, only a subset of key data is available here. 

To ensure transparency and reproducibility, a complete version of the dataset will be made available through additional public data-sharing platforms upon acceptance of this paper. 

This will enable the community to access the full dataset, allowing for thorough analysis and supporting the validity of our results.

The partial dataset currently shared provides sufficient information for preliminary insights and initial exploration. 

The shared datasets include:

- **`CybersquattingNFT.csv`**: A complete list of all identified Cybersquatting NFT collections.
  
- **`NFTMetadata.csv`**: Metadata for all 220,918 NFTs in the study.
  
- **`NFTTokenURI.csv`**: The URI for each NFT token. Due to GitHub’s storage constraints, only 10,000 entries are included here.
  
- **`NFTTransfer.csv`**: Transfer data for all NFTs. A subset of 10,000 entries is provided due to GitHub’s storage limit.

- **`MarketTrade.csv`**: Secondary market trade data for all NFTs. A subset of 10,000 entries is provided due to GitHub’s storage limit.

The files **`NFTTokenURI.csv`**, **`NFTTransfer.csv`**, and **`MarketTrade.csv`** contain extensive data that exceeds GitHub’s storage limit. 
Therefore, each of these files includes only a subset of 10,000 entries to ensure accessibility within the platform’s constraints.

**Nevertheless, if reviewers require access to the full dataset during the review process, we will make the requested subset available in the rebuttal phase.**
